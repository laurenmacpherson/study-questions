For Recipes.java: 

    Scaling factor = (# of desired portions)/(# of default portions)

    Main Scaled Weight = (weight of main ingredient)*(scaling factor)

    For each other ingredient: 
        Scaled Weight = (Baker's %)*(Main Scaled Weight)

    Input format: 
        # of Recipes
        [# of ingredients] [default portions] [desired portions]
        <Ingredient name> <weight> <percentage>

    Use 2D array because we know the # of things used and we don't need to be searching (order also matters) 

    Array[percentage][name]

    loop will remember the index of %100
